# Initial Working Agreement
## Our Healthy team
* Respect each other
* Communicate early and often about availability and obstacles
* Help each other and feel free to ask for help

## Meeting Schedule
* Every MWF morning, we all chat to check in with each other about if we have any roadblocks and/or what progress has been made (daily scrum)

## Commits
* Branch every time you start to work on something
  * Create an issue in gitlab and assign it to yourself
  * Create a branch with the 'Create Merge Request' button in gitlab
  * Checkout the branch on your local Android Studio (You may need to fetch remote branches)
  * Submit a merge request on gitlab to the main branch and get another team member to review it

* Commit often
* If there are merge conflicts, ask for help from the team

## Coding and naming conventions
* Camel case (thisIsAnExample)
* Use descriptive variable and function names
* Comment frequently
* Commit title should be very brief, but body of commit message should include somewhat specific changes in a bulleted list

## Tests
* Write tests for every major function
* Organize tests in an understandable format
* Run tests before submitting a merge request

## Documentation
* Write appropriate JavaDoc comments for any new functions that are implmented or changed.
* Create or pdate appropriate UML diagrams or other design documents with any new or updated functionality.

## Responsibilities
### General
* for individual changes, only the main author tests them in their own branch since they understand their own code best (but can optionally ask another group member to pull and test it to ensure consistency).
* for milestones, all group members should test the code to ensure it works as expected before submitting
* for updating project documentation such as UML Diagrams, pairs of people that are familiar with the code will update the diagrams as needed

### Specific Roles (TBD)

## Time Expectations
* On monday, set deadline of what you can get done in that week (by next monday)
* If there are issues with this, communicate with the rest of the team
* On friday, if not enough work has been done on a specific work item, let the team know and they can pickup some of the slack (sort out git merge problems prior to them occuring)
* Dependent on the work that is being done

## Questions on requirements
* Ask plumlee in the discord if no one else has any valuable input during the daily scrum
